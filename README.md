This project was done for our final exam in the "Introduction to Data Science" course. 
The aim of this project was to utilised some simple ML models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Regression, and XGBoost Regression to predict house prices given some features of the particular house. Our result indicated that the XGBoost Regression outperformed the aforementioned models with some little tweaks to its hyperparameters.

The data used was the AMES Housing Data taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
